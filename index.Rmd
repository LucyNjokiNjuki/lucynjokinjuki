I am Lucy Njoki Njuki, currently employed as a Data Analyst at the [Nufflied Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Scienes (NDORMS), University of Oxford](https://www.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/). 

Simultaneously, I am pursuing my MSc in Statistics and Data Science (Biostatistics) as a part-time second-year student at Hasselt University through a distance learning program. Alongside my academic pursuits, I actively contribute to the R community and serve as an organiser for [R-Ladies Nairobi chapter](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-nairobi/).
